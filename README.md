# LEDController

This repository contains code to control an LED system consisting of multiple LEDs, using Arduino UNO.

To use the code with an Arduino UNO, for instance, the file can be used as a sketch with the Arduino IDE. Certain lines must be added to the sketch, i.e., the lines to define the LEDs to be controlled and the part of the program that needs to be run on loop.

The given code defines and initializes the LED group. Whatever criteria needs to be updated can also be done using the respective function. It is advisable to carry out these actions outside the main loop.
